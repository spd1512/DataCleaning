# DataCleaning
This repository named DataCleaning is a submission for the "Getting And Cleaning Data" Course project on Coursera.  
It contains the code and instructions for creating a Tidy Dataset   

### Dataset Used :
The dataset used was "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone"  
This dataset is available here:<a>https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a>  

### run_analysis.R
This is the main script for performing data cleaning on the given dataset based on following criteria:  
Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

### Codebook.md
A codebook that contains all the required information and describes the variables, the data and all the transformations used for cleaning the data.  

### TidyData.txt
The final dataset obtained after cleaning the data and performing all the steps mentioned above.  
This dataset is in .txt format
